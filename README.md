# Module20Challenge
Smart Contracts with Solidity

In this challenge we have been tasked to create a Solidity smart contract that accepts the two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. The smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institution’s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.

## Usage

A completed Solidity JointSavings smart contract can be found be in file **joint_savings.sol** in the main directory of this repository.

The contract was complied and delployed in the JavaScript VM (in Remix-Ethereum IDE).

All the required deposit and withdrawal transactions (using the deployed Smart Contract) images have been uploaded to the **Execution_Results** folder of this repository.
